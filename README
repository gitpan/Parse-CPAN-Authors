SYNOPSIS
      use Parse::CPAN::Authors;

      # must have downloaded and un-gzip-ed
      my $p = Parse::CPAN::Authors->new("01mailrc.txt");
      # either a filename as above or pass in the contents of the file
      my $p = Parse::CPAN::Authors->new($mailrc_contents);

      my $a = $p->author('AASSAD');
      # $a is a Parse::CPAN::Authors::Author object
      print $a->pauseid, "\n"; # AASSAD
      print $a->name, "\n";    # Arnaud 'Arhuman' Assad
      print $a->email, "\n";   # arhuman@hotmail.com

      # all the author objects
      my @authors = $p->authors;

DESCRIPTION
    The Comprehensive Perl Archive Network (CPAN) is a very useful
    collection of Perl code. It has several indices of the files that it
    hosts, including a file named "01mailrc.txt.gz" in the "authors"
    directory. This file contains lots of useful information on CPAN authors
    and this module provides a simple interface to the data contained
    within.

    Note that this module does not concern itself with downloading or
    unpacking this file. You should do this yourself.

    The constructor takes either the path to the 01mailrc.txt file or its
    contains. It defaults to loading the file from the current directory.
    You must download and un-gzip it yourself.

    In a future release Parse::CPAN::Authors::Author might have more
    information.
